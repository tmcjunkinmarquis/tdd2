// break unsorted array in half, half, half until ...
// then merge them back together

// split array in half (array of 8, 4 and 4)
// take right side half: now have two unsorted arrays in half(2 and 2)
// right side only: split to 1 and 1 
// left compare to right,
// put into sorted array, nothing to compare remainder to so just push onto sorted array.
// merge two arrayso fo 2: compare index 0 to index 0, move smaller to new sorted.
// compare 1 to 1,
// then zero to zero
// then tack on the end

// now left side:

// left 2, right two
// left into singles: zero to zero, smaller into sorted, 
// index zero to zero
// now have two sorted arrays of two

// zero to zero, smaller goes into new sorted
// zero to zero, until tack remainder to the end

// now merge 4 and 4 arrrays


// always comparing index zero to index zero
